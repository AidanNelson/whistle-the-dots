whistle-the-dots
=========================

Draw lines to connect the dots, with sound!

You and a friend will move the drawing dot together with your voices. 

Control movement along the X axis with pitch (low to high), and change position on the Y axis with volume (soft to loud).

Each player should navigate here on their own computer: https://whistle-the-dots.glitch.me/
